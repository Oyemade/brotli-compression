# Brotli Compression

This project uses the webpack [**brotli-webpack-plugin**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/brotli-webpack-plugin) to compress files with the [Brotli Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli).

# How to use

-- Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies

-- Copy the file to be compressed into the `src` folder

-- In the `webpack.config.js` file replace "[file-name]" with the name of the file to be compressed

-- In the terminal run `npm start`

-- Compressed file would be available in the generated `public` folder
